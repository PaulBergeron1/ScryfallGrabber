# ScryfallGrabber
Uses scryfall api to grab card names from a file

Usage:
Create cards.txt file in same directory as getCards.py
put cards in cards.txt file with a card name on each line

Ex:
Godo, Bandit Warlord
Lotus Petal
Dockside Extortionist
Fellwar Stone
City of Traitors

Since the code examines all-cards database, it may take a little for the cards to appear, simply wait until they do

Card images will appear in a new folder created in the same directory called "art"
